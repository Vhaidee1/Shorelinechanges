## Introduction
  -	Type of satellite: Laser altimeter
  -	Overview of how the laser altimeter measures sea surface height (SSH), ocean swells, tides, wind speed and sea level         rise (SLR) on a global scale
  -	Research Questions:
    -	How do wave conditions change throughout the year during an ENSO event compared to a normal year?
    -	How do changes in wave conditions contribute to beach accretion and shoreline change over the course of a year on the       West Coast?
    -	How do winds contribute to sea surface height near the West Coast?
## Proposed Research
  -	Compare seasonal sea surface height (SSH) and sea level rise (SLR) during an ENSO year and a normal year using a time       series derived from the altimeter data.
  -	Analyze data from the laser altimeter to assess its contribution to changes in beach accretion and shoreline changes         at Main Beach and Cowell's Beach, utilizing USGS shoreline data.
  -	Compare this data to wave conditions along the West Coast using the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP).
  -	Apply SSH and SLR to analyze existing images to measure its contribution to beach accretion and shoreline change.
  -	Use Larson’s sand transport model to compare shoreline change as a function of significant wave height, correlating         it with satellite data.
## Expected Outcomes
  -	Create a global-scale SSH and SLR analysis for ENSO and normal years for each season using GRIDSPEC in Python.
  - Generate filtered time series of images, if feasible.
  - Zoom in on the West Coast SSH and SLR data and visualize it using a colormap in Python.
  -  Develop figures representing beach accretion and shoreline position for each season based on current images.
  -  Create a figure for Larson’s sand transport model in Python, presented as either a histogram or a plot.
## Limitations and challenges
- 	RMSE: found in the laser altimeter compared to modeled SSH/SLR
    -  Also, RMSE in beach accretion and shoreline position. 
- 	Any other Challenges I found
