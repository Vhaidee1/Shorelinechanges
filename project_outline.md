I. Introduction
  A.	Type of satellite: Laser altimeter
  B.	Overview of how the laser altimeter measures sea surface height (SSH), ocean swells, tides, wind speed and sea level rise (SLR) on a global scale
  C.	Research Questions:
    1.	How do wave conditions change throughout the year during an ENSO event compared to a normal year?
    2.	How do changes in wave conditions contribute to beach accretion and shoreline change over the course of a year on the West Coast?
    3.	Can the laser altimeter measure fine-scale profiles, such as those in the swash zone?
II. Proposed Research
  A.	Compare seasonal sea surface height (SSH) and sea level rise (SLR) during an ENSO year and a normal year using a time series derived from the altimeter data.
  B.	Analyze data from the laser altimeter to assess its contribution to changes in beach accretion and shoreline changes at Main Beach and Cowell's Beach, utilizing USGS shoreline data.
  C.	Compare this data to wave conditions along the West Coast using the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP).
  D.	Apply SSH and SLR to analyze existing images to measure its contribution to beach accretion and shoreline change.
  E.	Use Larson’s sand transport model to compare shoreline change as a function of significant wave height, correlating it with satellite data.
III. Expected Outcomes
  A.	Create a global-scale SSH and SLR analysis for ENSO and normal years for each season using GRIDSPEC in Python.
  B.	Generate filtered time series of images, if feasible.
  C.	Zoom in on the West Coast SSH and SLR data and visualize it using a colormap in Python.
  D.	Develop figures representing beach accretion and shoreline position for each season based on current images.
  E.	Create a figure for Larson’s sand transport model in Python, presented as either a histogram or a plot.
IV. Limitations and challenges
  A.	RMSE: found in the laser altimeter compared to modeled SSH/SLR
    1.	Also, RMSE in beach accretion and shoreline position. 
  B.	Any other Challenges I found
