# Abstract
Quantifying beach volume and shoreline position is challenging due to their complexity and the influencing factors, such as wave conditions. While buoys provide valuable data, their distribution is limited. Satellite altimeter can offer broader coverage, measuring wave conditions including sea surface height, swells, tides, wind speed and even sea level rise. For example, a laser altimeter can track sea surface height (SSH) during ENSO events or over seasons throughout the year, revealing trends in approaching patterns and even SSH along with sea level rise. This study will utilize SSH and SLR data from the satellite altimeter and apply calculations for beach volume and shoreline position from the US Geological Survey (USGS) for Main Beach and Cowell’s Beach, covering the period from September 23, 2023, to September 24, 2024. Additionally, wave data from the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) will be incorporated during the same timeframe to measure beach accretion and shoreline position from USGS images, separate from the previously conducted analysis. Larson’s sand transport model will be applied to estimate shoreline position, allowing for a comparison between the model’s results and those derived from the satellite altimeter data to assess the accuracy of the altimeter at fine-scale profiles. I anticipate differences in accuracy for both beach accretion and shoreline position due to SSH from the altimeter and CDIP wave data. I also believe SLR will change SSH causing lower beach accretion and faster shoreline position changes.
